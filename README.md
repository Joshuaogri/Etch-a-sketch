### Challenges

Getting the value derived from the prompt function turned out to be an unexpected challenge. Typically, I would design my dialogue box but felt it was doable and it turned out so. The main challenge with the prompt function was validating it from every possible angle to ensure all input possibilities were taken care of. Deriving the grids, did not involve much effort and took place rather speedily. However, the onmouse event took some time to figure out during the final stages. I also figured, i could easily create my array of colours although, i did not delve deeper. The project was tough because of the need to combine several methods and selectors but eventually i pulled it off. However, i may have been unable to relate with the 10% black addition on 10 passes enough to deploy it.
